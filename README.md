## About

Technical Writer with **13+ years of experience** building and scaling product documentation, content strategy, design workflows, and process standardisation for enterprise SaaS, iPaaS, API, and cloud platforms. I specialise in turning complex systems into clear, structured documentation — owning everything from API references and release notes to structured knowledge bases and large-scale content migrations.

I excel at leading cross-functional collaboration with engineering, product, design, and support teams — improving content quality, discoverability, and customer adoption through thoughtful strategy and disciplined execution.

Proficient in SDLC and DDLC methodologies, structured authoring with DITA and Paligo, docs-as-code workflows, and AI-assisted documentation tooling.
